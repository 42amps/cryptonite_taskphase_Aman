# where are the robots
To solve this challenge, let's start by understanding the robots.txt file.

The robots.txt file is a simple text file that tells web crawlers which parts of a website they should or shouldn’t crawl. It’s essentially a set of guidelines that says, 
"Hey, bots—please avoid these areas." We can find it at the root of a domain by going to https://example.com/robots.txt. 
This file follows a standard called the Robots Exclusion Protocol.

In real-world websites, robots.txt helps manage how search engines index content, preventing crawlers from accessing sensitive but non-secret areas.
